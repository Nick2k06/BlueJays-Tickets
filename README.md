# BlueJays-Tickets
The Toronto Blue Jays Postseason is about to begin! Before the playoffs start, however, they have asked Mr. Baquialâ€™s grade 11 computer science students to help handle their single game ticket ordering system. In the ticket ordering program you are to calculate ticket orders based on the ticket prices shown below:

In the Action
$360.00

Premium Dugout
$106.50

Premium Infield
$97.00

Field Level Infield
$94.50

Field Level Bases
$91.00

100 Level Outfield
$50.00

Your program should ask the user how many of each seat location tickets they would like to order. Then at the end, the program will calculate the total with tax.
